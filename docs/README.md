# UrbanFlow AI Documentation

## Project Overview

UrbanFlow AI is a smart bike demand forecasting system for New York City. The project uses data from Citi Bike, weather APIs, and traffic data to predict bike sharing demand across the city.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Forecasting**: Predicts bike demand up to 24 hours in advance
- **Weather Sensitivity**: Analyzes how weather conditions affect bike usage
- **Traffic Integration**: Correlates traffic patterns with bike usage
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualizes predictions and historical patterns
- **AI-Powered Assistant**: Provides insights through natural language queries

## Data Sources

1. **Citi Bike Data**: Trip data including start/end stations, timestamps, bike types
2. **Weather Data**: Hourly temperature, precipitation, wind speed
3. **Traffic Data**: Vehicle counts from ATR (Automatic Traffic Recorders)

## Key Insights

- Electric bikes are used for trips that are 30% longer on average than classic bikes
- Precipitation reduces bike usage by approximately 40%
- Weekday usage peaks during commute hours (7-9am, 5-7pm)
- Weekend usage is more evenly distributed with higher concentration in recreational areas
- Temperature is the strongest predictor of bike usage, with optimal range being 15-25Â°C
