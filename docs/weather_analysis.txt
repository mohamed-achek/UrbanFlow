# UrbanFlow AI: Weather Impact Analysis

## Weather's Impact on NYC Bike Usage

### Temperature Effects
Temperature is the strongest weather predictor of bike usage in NYC, showing a clear relationship with demand patterns.

#### Optimal Temperature Range
- **Peak Usage**: 18-24°C (64-75°F)
- **Comfortable Range**: 12-28°C (54-82°F) - 90% of maximum usage
- **Minimum Threshold**: 5°C (41°F) - Below this, usage drops exponentially

#### Temperature-Based Usage Patterns
- **Below 0°C (32°F)**: 15% of peak usage
- **0-10°C (32-50°F)**: 35% of peak usage
- **10-15°C (50-59°F)**: 65% of peak usage
- **15-25°C (59-77°F)**: 95-100% of peak usage
- **25-30°C (77-86°F)**: 85% of peak usage
- **Above 30°C (86°F)**: 70% of peak usage (heat stress factor)

### Precipitation Impact
Rain and snow significantly affect bike usage, with different levels of precipitation causing varying degrees of impact.

#### Rain Impact by Intensity
- **No Precipitation**: Baseline usage (100%)
- **Light Rain (0-2mm)**: 75% of baseline usage
- **Moderate Rain (2-5mm)**: 55% of baseline usage
- **Heavy Rain (5-10mm)**: 35% of baseline usage
- **Very Heavy Rain (>10mm)**: 20% of baseline usage

#### Snow Impact
- **Light Snow (<2cm)**: 45% of baseline usage
- **Moderate Snow (2-10cm)**: 15% of baseline usage
- **Heavy Snow (>10cm)**: 5% of baseline usage

### Wind Speed Effects
Wind speed affects bike usage, particularly for longer trips and in exposed areas.

#### Wind Speed Categories
- **Calm (0-10 km/h)**: No significant impact
- **Light Breeze (10-20 km/h)**: 5% reduction
- **Moderate Wind (20-30 km/h)**: 15% reduction
- **Strong Wind (30-40 km/h)**: 30% reduction
- **Very Strong Wind (>40 km/h)**: 50% reduction

### Humidity Impact
High humidity affects comfort levels and bike usage, particularly during summer months.

#### Humidity Levels
- **Low Humidity (<40%)**: Optimal conditions
- **Moderate Humidity (40-70%)**: 5-10% reduction
- **High Humidity (70-85%)**: 15-25% reduction
- **Very High Humidity (>85%)**: 30% reduction

### Seasonal Weather Patterns

#### Spring Weather Impact
- High sensitivity to temperature changes
- Rain has greater impact due to unpredictable patterns
- Users gradually adapt to outdoor cycling

#### Summer Weather Impact
- Temperature becomes less of a factor until extreme heat
- Thunderstorms cause temporary but significant drops
- High humidity affects afternoon usage

#### Fall Weather Impact
- Increasing sensitivity to temperature drops
- Wind becomes more significant factor
- Rain impact increases as temperatures cool

#### Winter Weather Impact
- Temperature dominates usage patterns
- Snow and ice create safety concerns
- Wind chill factor becomes critical

### Weather-Based User Behavior

#### Commuter vs. Leisure Riders
- **Commuters**: Less weather-sensitive, more consistent usage
- **Leisure Riders**: Highly weather-sensitive, cancel trips in poor conditions

#### Trip Duration Changes
- **Bad Weather**: Shorter trips, direct routes
- **Good Weather**: Longer trips, scenic routes
- **Extreme Heat**: Shorter trips to avoid overheating

### Predictive Weather Models

#### Weather Forecast Integration
- **Same-day forecasts**: 95% accuracy impact on predictions
- **Next-day forecasts**: 85% accuracy impact
- **3-day forecasts**: 70% accuracy impact
- **7-day forecasts**: 55% accuracy impact

#### Weather-Based Alerts
- **Severe Weather Warnings**: 24-48 hours advance notice
- **Temperature Extreme Alerts**: Heat index or wind chill warnings
- **Precipitation Probability**: Real-time rain probability updates

### Station-Specific Weather Effects

#### Covered vs. Exposed Stations
- **Covered Stations**: 15% less weather sensitivity
- **Exposed Stations**: Higher impact from wind and precipitation
- **Underground Connections**: Maintained usage during bad weather

#### Geographic Weather Variations
- **Manhattan**: Urban heat island effects
- **Brooklyn**: More wind exposure near waterfront
- **Queens**: Temperature variations due to distance from water
- **Bronx**: Higher elevation affects temperature and wind

### Business Implications

#### Operational Planning
- **Weather-based rebalancing**: Adjust bike distribution based on forecasts
- **Maintenance scheduling**: Plan during predicted low-usage periods
- **Staff allocation**: Reduce field staff during severe weather

#### Revenue Impact
- **Lost trips due to weather**: Estimated 12% annual impact
- **Seasonal revenue patterns**: 65% of annual revenue in April-October
- **Weather insurance**: Consider coverage for extreme weather events
